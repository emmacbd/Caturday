## About The Project
Caturday is a place for both cat-enthusiasts and new-to-cats-users to learn more about cat breeds and potentially find one that would match their lifestyleâ€” all in a Western theme.

This was an assignment from Turing School of Software and Design's Front End Engineering program, known as the Stretch Tech project. Stretch Tech is a group project focused on learning and implementing a new technology with peers rather than being taught by instructors with a structured curriculum. We chose to learn and implement Typescript. 

    It's a-meow-zing what you can learn in just a week! 

With this application users are able to view a cat of the day, a list of cat breeds fetched from a RESTful API. To learn more about a breed, the user can click on the wanted poster preview and get additional information. Users can also filter by the affection level of cats

## Using the Application
Upon load, a user will see a featured **Cat of the Day** below the Caturday title. Upon hover, the cat in the sky welcomes the user with a friendly "Meowdy Folks!" To learn about a cat, the user can slimply click on the Wanted poster. They can return home by clicking Cat of the Day or All Cats from the sidebar, using the brower back button, or removing the `/cats/(cat's id)` from the URL.

#### Filtering By Affection
If intending to adopt a breed, the user can select an affection level to see what cat matches their style. If no cats are a match the search, they will be shown an error message.
